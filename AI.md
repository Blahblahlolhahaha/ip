## A-BetterGUI

Used Copilot chat to implement a better GUI as compared to the base gui that was created in the tutorial.

Initial prompt was:
```
please improve my gui for the javafx by using css
```
AI then implemented changes to use CSS to enhance the GUI by implementing circle profile pictures together with better colors for the UI.

However there were a few clipping issues which I used the following prompts to solve:

```
I don't want the view to be horizontally scrollable, ideally the view should be able to be viewed without scrolling horitonally
```

This allowed Copilot to make changes to the UI and bound widths to make the view fit within the constraints without the need to scroll horizontally
